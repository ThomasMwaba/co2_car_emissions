In **co2_car_emissios** project we create a model that can predict how much carbon dioxide (CO2) a vehicle produces.
The following **Python** libraries are used in the project:

1. **Pandas** was used to organize and clean up the data.

2. **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** were used to create graphs  that helped with understanding the data better.
3. **Scikit-learn** was used to make a model that can predict CO2 emissions based on things like how much fuel a vehicle uses and the size of its engine.

**Note**: The file is in IPYNB format.
