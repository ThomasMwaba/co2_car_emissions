This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict CO2 emissions from vehicles.
CO2 emissions from vehicles are a significant contributor to environmental pollution and climate change. By building a predictive model, the aim is to provide a tool that can estimate the CO2 emissions of a vehicle based on its characteristics. This can assist in:

1. Environmental Awareness: Helping consumers make more environmentally responsible choices when purchasing vehicles.
2. Policy Development: Supporting governments in implementing eco-friendly regulations and incentives.
3. Automobile Design: Assisting car manufacturers in optimizing vehicle designs for reduced emissions.
