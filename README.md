In this project, we create a model that can predict how much carbon dioxide (CO2) a vehicle produces.
The following Python libraries are used in the project:
·##Pandas## was used to organize and clean up the data. This helps us make sure the information is correct and consistent.
·Seaborn and Matplotlib were used to create graphs  that help us understand the data better. These graphs show how different things in the data are related.
·Scikit-learn was used to make a model that predicts CO2 emissions based on things like how much fuel a vehicle uses and the size of its engine.
