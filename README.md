This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict CO2 emissions by first employing Pandas  for efficient data cleaning, transformation, and structuring, ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the analysis. Seaborn played a pivotal role in creating informative and visually engaging plots, facilitating the exploration of relationships within the dataset. Finally, the scikit-learn library was used to develop a predictive model for estimating CO2 emissions based on factors such as fuel consumption and engine size.
